    <h1>More Positives Than Negatives</h1>

    <p>The Internet has many benefits. You can view destinations that are a thousand miles away via a quick google map search. This allows you to visit somewhere you may physically never go without having to leave your house. You can get a feel for that destinations environment as you read up on local cultural beliefs and view the destination's architecture via street view and images. All of this can be achieved without physically leaving your house.</p>

    <p>Do you have a friend who you own money to for rent? Thanks to the Internet, you can instantly transfer that friend his money through online banking. The Internet has helped simplify daily tasks as well as learning.</p>

    <p> As the Internet has many benefits, it also comes with many downsides. Sensitive information can be shared at a click of a button. Social media platforms such as Instagram let you stay connected with friends. This seems like a positive, yet how much information is too much information. When you put something on the web, anyone can see it. Without knowing, you could potentially leak personal information which can result in outcomes as severe as death as seen by the recent tragedy of Pop Smoke's murder.
    </p>

    <p>Overall I would rate the Internet a 7.5 out of 10.</p>
